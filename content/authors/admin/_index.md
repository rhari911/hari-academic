## About Me

Hi. I am an Assistant Professor of Managerial Accounting at the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management. I am broadly interested in understanding how firms use a variety of control instruments to improve firm and employee outcomes.

I graduated from the Eli Broad College of Business, Michigan State University, with a Ph.D. in Accounting. Before the Ph.D. program, I taught courses in financial accounting, management accounting, and corporate finance for students pursuing Chartered Accountancy in Mumbai, India.
